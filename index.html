<h2>Hey, I'm Shabano!</h2>

<p style="color: purple;">Hi everyone! My name is Shabano and I'm in my 1B term of the
Math/BBA Double Degree program at the University of Waterloo. I am really interested
in roles relating to software development and consulting. Outside of work,
I love hanging out with friends, family and listening to Taylor Swift. I also love to travel
and one of my favorite places is Oahu, Hawaii. You can find my resume
as well as my blog about my travel + uni experiences here! Feel free to reach out :)</p>

    <h2>August, 2023 - Trip to Hawaii</h2>
    <p2>This was my first time going to Hawaii. I was very excited to go
        and had a wonderful time with my family. Over the week that we were there,
        we went on many hikes, explored the many beaches Oahu has to offer, and most importantly,
        spent time with our extended family. The ocean was breathtaking, with colors ranging from turquoise
        to a dark blue, something I had never seen before. I also loved to just sit and watch the waves roll by; I
        had never experienced such large waves before. The sand was just like clay and together, everything felt unreal.
